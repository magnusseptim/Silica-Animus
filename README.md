Heh, in fact it is just a re-worked Microsoft  (Use ML.NET in a sentiment analysis binary classification scenario) example.

I would like to check, how it will work with few aditional technologies as API.

## Concepts :
- Create API with simple ML engine to check how this techs works together
- Use JWT as authentication
- Use NLog as logger
- Use Swagger as Doc
- Use few features from newest C# editions

## Tech stack :
- .NET Core 2.0
- Entity Framework (for IdentityDbContext) 6.2.0
- NLog (4.5.6) (Logging)
- NLog.Web.AspNetCore (4.5.4) (Logging in Core)
- Swashbuckle.AspNetCore (Working as a API doc)
- Microsoft.ML (0.3.0) (mmm, Meat !)
- Xunit (2.3.1) and Moq (4.9.0) (tests)
